I'm from Gujarat, India. Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm consistent only in one thing, which is procrastination. I practice procrastination regularly. I believe in doing the bare minimum. If you text me in the morning,  you will probably receive a reply at midnight because I have dedicated one hour to socializing, and I don't want to get into a conversation after replying during the day. That's enough, I guess.
