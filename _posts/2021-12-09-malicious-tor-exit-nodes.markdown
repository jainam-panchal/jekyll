#  Malicious Tor Exit Nodes
<br>

Recent research revealed that some people are running hundreds of malicious servers on the Tor Network. Since putting servers on the tor network is completely volunteering bases even you can run your exit node or relay but it is always suggested to inform your ISP about this because if there is any illegal traffic going through your relay it would troublesome for you and the ISP.

Assuming Man in the middle attack with the use of these malicious nodes. I don’t think even if someone is doing Man the middle attack can reverse trace the specific person because the Tor Traffic is routed with multiple international nodes but It can surely downgrade the security of the network traffic. Malicious threat actors can just decrypt the traffic and encrypt the response with their own key so it would look legitimate. A Security Researcher nusenu who runs their own node on the Tor network posted on his blog about “KAX17” which seems to be running literally hundreds of malicious servers all over the world which can compromise a Tor user’s anonymity. KAX had around 900 so servers running at the point and that’s a large number if you were to be using the tor network it could have been around a 16% chance of using their relay as the first hop of your tor tunneling. If he can scale his strength and keep adding more servers he could have over half of tor network. Tor admins seem to be aware of this and also started investigating relay owners before adding them to tor network. Still, there is no solid evidence that threat actors are performing de-anonymization attacks but they are in a position to do so.

Tor is a standard in the world of internet privacy. So obvious that it would attract cybercriminals and the government if they can scrape out something. The government may want to monitor online activity, surveil citizens, or even check up on other countries. Tor is one of the best ways to get around censorship and to protect their online presence for people like journalists. Still, we should be aware of its restrictions. These are my thoughts on the topic I would still suggest you read more articles on the topic some of them are more with factual statistics.
